## The Problem
I was at a farmer's market buying honey, when I asked them about how climate change was affecting their business. It was here when I learned about the devastating outlook of bees and all the issues they and their keepers faced. From parasites to pesticides, hotter summers and colder winters, and an ever-growing movement towards monocultures, there was a lot of problems which needed solving given our agricultural reliance on bees. It was this spark which inspired me to work with my classmates, capstone team, and ultimately colleagues to develop Nectarfy.

## The Engineering
Nectarfy has gone through many iterations since its inception. At first, we aimed to for the following features:
- Detect beehive weight
- Monitor internal temperature
- Monitor internal vibration
- Notify user of full beehive

There features were rudimentary at best, and was done between myself and a classmate as an exercise in firmware development.

 At first, it was a simple beehive with a weight
