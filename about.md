					<p>Thanks for checking this out! It's just a small site I've made for a quick showcase of what I get up to.<br/></p>
					<p>I'm a Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia in Canada! In terms of my career interests, I'm very interested in controls engineering, mechanical and product design, and anything sustainability related. My current project is a smart beehive! <br/><br/>
					Other than that though, I enjoy winter sports, as any Canadian, spent quite a bit of time consuming musicals and other forms of music, so much so that I've competed in Acappella competitively! <br/><br/>
					I am also an avid gamer, mostly competitive esports titles such as Overwatch and Valorant.<br/><br/>
					It's great to meet you!
