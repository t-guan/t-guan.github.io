From what I've learned so far with machine learning, I decided to try my had at my own project, to use my camera to translate American Manual Alphabet signs. While I recognize that this project itself won't actually be that useful
as ASL is a far superior system for signing, I thought it would be a good exercise as a culmination of the skills I've learned so far. Plus, it can help me practice my AMA signing.
