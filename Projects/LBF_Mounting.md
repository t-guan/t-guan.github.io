I undertook development of this piece of mounting hardware for an Australian client during my time with LB Foster Rail Technologies. This piece of hardware was custom designed to fit
the specific bogeys the client had. Afterwards, a device which would apply a lubricant directly to the wheel would be attached to the mounting hardware.
The lubricant had to be applied at an optimal angle, and could not interfere with the day-to-day operations of the vehicle. 

I designed this part through various iterations, but first started with identifying mounting locations on the bogey, and used CAD to come up with various designs. 
After creating each part, I ran FEA simulations to see how vibrations would affect the piece, and ensured it would survive the various mechanical loads it would expereince on the tracks.
During this process, I worked closely with the manufacturing team to review my designs and make sure it would be feasible to produce based on the material and the volume required.
