					<h3>Mobile Hotspots</h3>
				</header>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated and created variations of 3D Injection Moulded Design, with a focus on design for manufacturing.</li>
					<li>Performed tolerance analysis for components including the power button.</li>
					<li>Developed RF-Door covering concepts, performed tolerance analysis to confirm concepts with principal designer.</li>

					<h3>Gaming Router Concept</h3>
				</header>
				<ul>
					<li>Created prototype models of various articulating antenna hinge mechanisms in CAD and 3D printed them for testing and demonstration.</li>
					<li>Designed multiple variations of lighting features based on industrial design of the router concept.</li>
					<li>Performed ray-tracing simulations on lighting features by varing geometry and surface finish.</li>
					<li>Hand-soldered and etched PCBs to create prototype lighting features on 3D printed housings and lightpipes to verify and identify relationships between ray-tracing simulations and reality.</li>
					<li>Iterated through various versions of the mechanical design of the router, taking into account PCB, Radio-Frequency components, wiring, and budgeting constraints.</li>
