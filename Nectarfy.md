			<p>Nectarfy was born out of the New Venture Design course at UBC, where three business students and three engineers sought to create a venture. 
			My team eventually created Nectarfy, an agritech product with the aim of helping beekeepers save the bees. I was inspired to pursue this idea when speaking with local beekeepers at a famers market. After learning
			about the issues which have plagued bees for the past years, I decided to see how engineering could potentially solve their issues.</p>
			<h3>The Nectarfy Difference &emsp;</h3>
			<center>{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}</center>
			<p>Fundamentally, the issues Nectarfy aimed to solve was both to empower urban beekeepers</p>
			<p>The engineering team has written a complete report which can be found here. For my part on the project, I build the entire Varroa Mite Detection System while building parts of the physical beehive alongside my engineering team.

				<!--<p>Designed and tested various handheld and non-handheld plastic consumer connectivity devices, focused on <b>Design for Manufacturing</b> and <b>Design for Assembly</b> of various mechanical, optical, and electrical components. </p>
				<ul>
				<li>Designed, modeled, and improved hardware designs for applicator and bracket mounting hardware. These pieces of hardware were typically fabricated out of steel.</li>
				<li>Translated client requests into early prototypes, refined them, and produced ready-to-manufacture designs.</li>
				<li>Drew and maintained standard engineering drawings for both parts and large-scale assemblies.</li>
				<li>Performed tolerance analysis on designed parts to ensure fit on client bogeys.</li>
				<li>Collaborated with Machinists to ensure feasibility and robustness of designs.</li>
				<li>Performed Finite Element Analysis on designed parts to analyze and prevent operating failures, specifically stress, strain, and vibrations.</li>
				<li>Performed time-to-failure tests on hardware and built simulations to validate results.</li>
