			<dt><i>Mechanical Design Intern</i></dt> -->
			<p>Nectarfy was born out of the New Venture Design course at UBC, where three business students and three engineers sought to create a venture. 
			My team eventually created Nectarfy, an agritech product with the aim of helping beekeepers save the bees. I was inspired to pursue this idea when speaking with local beekeepers at a famers market. After learning
			about the issues which have plagued bees for the past years, I decided to see how engineering could potentially solve their issues.</p>
			<h3>The Nectarfy Difference &emsp;</h3>
			<center>{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}</center>
			<p>Fundamentally, the issues Nectarfy aimed to solve was both to empower urban beekeepers and assist commercial beekepers with two key points, winter survival and varroa mite detection.</p>
			<p>From our research, bee survival rates through the winter are getting worse and worse as climate change affects the duration and severity of the winters. Furthemore, the varroa mite, a parasite whose life cycle rests on killing bees, have been an ever growing issue for beekeepers.</p>
			<p>Nectarfy was a hive with three major features, an AI varroa mite detection system, a semi-autonomous food mixer and dispenser, and a heating system. Furthermore, the hive was to have an app which allowed the user to monitor and control the beehive remotely.</p>
